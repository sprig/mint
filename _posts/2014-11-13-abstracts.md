### <a id="HBer1"></a> Propagation in non homogeneous media and applications ####


Lecture 1. Monday, December 1st, 12:15 (sharp) , room Schreiber 006

#### Abstract: ####

The classical theory of the Fisher and Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov
equation derives the spreading
properties for a reaction-diffusion equation in a homogeneous setting. A
well known /invasion speed/
governs the asymptotic speed of propagation. This equation plays an
important role in a variety of
contexts in ecology, biology and physics. In this talk, I will first
introduce reaction-diffusion equations,
and describe some of their motivations as well as the underlying
mechanism. I will then review the
classical theory for homogeneous Fisher-KPP equations.

In applications, one often wishes to understand the effects of
heterogeneity. This leads to challenging
mathematical questions and I will describe some of them. I will then
discuss more in detail the effect of
inclusion of a line with fast diffusion on biological invasions in the
plane. I will report on recent results
on this question.

### <a id="HBer2"></a> The effect of domain shape on propagation and blocking for reaction-diffusion equations ###

Lecture 2. Wednesday, December 3rd, 14:10 (sharp), room Schreiber 209

#### Abstract: ####

I will discuss reaction-diffusion equations motivated by
biology and medicine for which the aim
is to understand the effect of the shape of the domain on propagation or
on blocking of advancing waves.

I will first describe the motivations of these questions. I will then
discuss various geometric conditions that
lead to either blocking, or partial propagation, or complete
propagation. These questions involve qualitative
results for some non-linear elliptic and parabolic partial differential
equations.
