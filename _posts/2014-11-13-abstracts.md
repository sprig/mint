### <a id="VanVu1"></a> Random matrices: Gaps between eigenvalues ###

#### Abstract: ####
Gaps (or spacings) between consecutive eigenvalues of a random hermitian matrix plays a central role in random matrix theory.
When Wigner used random matrix as a model in physics, it was the behavior of the gaps that captured his attention.
Another famous example is the  Dyson-Montgomery discussion  connecting these gaps with gaps between zeroes of the zeta function.

On the other hand, we still do not understand these gaps very well  at the microscopic level. For instance, it has only been proved very recently by Tao and the speaker that  for a random +-1 matrix, with high probability  all gaps are positive.

In this talk, we will discuss some recent progress in bounding these gaps, based on purely combinatorial techniques,
 for very general classes of random matrices. We will also present  applications in both computer science
and numerical analysis (among others, solutions to  questions by Babai, and by Deker-Lee-Linial).

Joint work with H. Nguyen (OSU) and T. Tao (UCLA).

### <a id="VanVu2"></a> Roots of random polynomials with general coefficients. ###

#### Abstract: ####
Roots of polynomials  with random coefficients have been studied for a long time,
starting with fundamental works of Littlewood and Offord in the 1940s, who showed that
random polynomials  with iid coefficients have very few  real roots.  Polynomials with iid coefficients are frequently referred to
as Kac polynomials.

The number of real roots of Kac polynomials has been computed
asymptotically  thanks to a remarkable sequence of works by Kac, Erdos-Offord, and Ibragimov-Maslova.
However, we know very little about all other cases, where the coefficients are independent, but can have different distributions
(different variances, for instance).

In this talk, we are going to give a  review of these classical works, focusing on the main ideas behind them,  and then
 present a recent development that provides a good understanding for polynomials with general coefficients with moderate growth (these coefficients can even have
implicit variances).  As a corollary, we   refine and extend Ibragimov-Maslova result for hyperbolic  polynomials. The talk is self-contained and several open questions will also be
discussed.

Joint work with O. Nguyen (Yale) and Y. Do (UoV).

### <a id="Olshanski1"></a> Markov processes of algebraic origin ###

#### Abstract: ####
The Brownian motion on the group U(N) of unitary matrices gives rise to a
Markov process on the matrix eigenvalues, that is, on N-particle
configurations on the circle (Freeman Dyson, 1962). Heuristic arguments
show that there should exist an analogous process with infinitely many
particles. However, its rigorous construction is a difficult problem, and
success in this direction has been achieved only in recent years. I will
describe a different model of continuous time Markov dynamics, which is
dual to Dyson's model in the sense that it is formulated in terms of
representations of the groups U(N) rather than eigenvalues. It turns out
that in the "dual" model, the transition to N=infinity can be carried out
by essentially algebraic tools. This is in contrast with Dyson's model
whose study in the N=infinity case requires hard analytic work.

### <a id="Olshanski2"></a> What are infinite random permutations? ###

#### Abstract: ####
Random permutations can be viewed as a combinatorial analog of random
matrices. In random matrix theory, people study the asymptotic behavior of
spectra of large random matrices. Likewise, the literature in combinatorial
probability contains many works on the limiting behavior of various
characteristics of random permutations of large size. But are there
reasonable models of random permutations of actually infinite size?
I will describe some positive results in this direction.

### <a id="Furman2"></a>  Simplicity of the Lyapunov spectrum via boundary theory ###

#### Abstract: ####
Consider products of matrices that are chosen using some ergodic
stationary random process on $G=SL(d,R)$, e.g. a random walk on $G$.
The Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (Oseledets) asserts that
asymptotically such products behave as $\exp(n\Lambda)$ where $\Lambda$
is a fixed diagonal traceless matrix, called the Lyapunov spectrum of
the system.
The spectrum $\Lambda$ depends on the system in a mysterious way, and
is almost never known explicitly.
The best understood case is that of random walks, where by the work of
Furstenberg, Guivarch-Raugi, and Gol'dsheid-Margulis we know that the
spectrum is simple (i.e. all values are distinct) provided the random
walk is not trapped in a proper algebraic subgroup.
Recently, Avila and Viana proved a conjecture of Kontsevich-Zorich
that asserts simplicity of the Lyapunov spectrum for another system
related to Teichmuller flow.

In the talk we shall describe an approach to proving simplicity of the
spectrum based on ideas from boundary theory that were developed to
prove rigidity of lattices.

Based on joint work with Uri Bader.

### <a id="Furman1"></a> Rigidity for groups with hidden symmetries ###

Abstract:
In the 1970s G.A.Margulis proved that linear representations of
certain discrete subgroups (namely lattices) in such Lie groups as
SL(3,R), are essentially determined by the ambient Lie group.
This phenomenon, known as superrigidity, has far reaching applications
and has inspired a large body of research in such areas as geometry,
dynamics, descriptive set theory, operator algebras etc.

We shall try to explain the superrigidity of lattices and related
groups by looking at some hidden symmetries (Weyl group) that they
inherit from the ambient group.

The talk is based on a joint work with Uri Bader.

### <a id="HBer1"></a> Propagation in non homogeneous media and applications ####


Lecture 1. Monday, December 1st, 12:15 (sharp) , room Schreiber 006

#### Abstract: ####

The classical theory of the Fisher and Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov
equation derives the spreading
properties for a reaction-diffusion equation in a homogeneous setting. A
well known /invasion speed/
governs the asymptotic speed of propagation. This equation plays an
important role in a variety of
contexts in ecology, biology and physics. In this talk, I will first
introduce reaction-diffusion equations,
and describe some of their motivations as well as the underlying
mechanism. I will then review the
classical theory for homogeneous Fisher-KPP equations.

In applications, one often wishes to understand the effects of
heterogeneity. This leads to challenging
mathematical questions and I will describe some of them. I will then
discuss more in detail the effect of
inclusion of a line with fast diffusion on biological invasions in the
plane. I will report on recent results
on this question.

### <a id="HBer2"></a> The effect of domain shape on propagation and blocking for reaction-diffusion equations ###

Lecture 2. Wednesday, December 3rd, 14:10 (sharp), room Schreiber 209

#### Abstract: ####

I will discuss reaction-diffusion equations motivated by
biology and medicine for which the aim
is to understand the effect of the shape of the domain on propagation or
on blocking of advancing waves.

I will first describe the motivations of these questions. I will then
discuss various geometric conditions that
lead to either blocking, or partial propagation, or complete
propagation. These questions involve qualitative
results for some non-linear elliptic and parabolic partial differential
equations.
