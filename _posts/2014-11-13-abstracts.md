### <a id="Furman2"></a>  Simplicity of the Lyapunov spectrum via Boundary theory ###

#### Abstract: ####
Consider products of matrices that are chosen using some ergodic
stationary random process on $G=SL(d,R)$, e.g. a random walk on $G$.
The Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (Oseledets) asserts that
asymptotically such products behave as $\exp(n\Lambda)$ where $\Lambda$
is a fixed diagonal traceless matrix, called the Lyapunov spectrum of
the system.
The spectrum $\Lambda$ depends on the system in a mysterious way, and
is almost never known explicitly.
The best understood case is that of random walks, where by the work of
Furstenberg, Guivarch-Raugi, and Gol'dsheid-Margulis we know that the
spectrum is simple (i.e. all values are distinct) provided the random
walk is not trapped in a proper algebraic subgroup.
Recently, Avila and Viana proved a conjecture of Kontsevich-Zorich
that asserts simplicity of the Lyapunov spectrum for another system
related to Teichmuller flow.

In the talk we shall describe an approach to proving simplicity of the
spectrum based on ideas from boundary theory that were developed to
prove rigidity of lattices.

Based on joint work with Uri Bader.

### <a id="Furman1"></a> Rigidity for groups with hidden symmetries ###

Abstract:
In the 1970s G.A.Margulis proved that linear representations of
certain discrete subgroups (namely lattices) in such Lie groups as
SL(3,R), are essentially determined by the ambient Lie group.
This phenomenon, known as superrigidity, has far reaching applications
and has inspired a large body of research in such areas as geometry,
dynamics, descriptive set theory, operator algebras etc.

We shall try to explain the superrigidity of lattices and related
groups by looking at some hidden symmetries (Weyl group) that they
inherit from the ambient group.

The talk is based on a joint work with Uri Bader.

### <a id="HBer1"></a> Propagation in non homogeneous media and applications ####


Lecture 1. Monday, December 1st, 12:15 (sharp) , room Schreiber 006

#### Abstract: ####

The classical theory of the Fisher and Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov
equation derives the spreading
properties for a reaction-diffusion equation in a homogeneous setting. A
well known /invasion speed/
governs the asymptotic speed of propagation. This equation plays an
important role in a variety of
contexts in ecology, biology and physics. In this talk, I will first
introduce reaction-diffusion equations,
and describe some of their motivations as well as the underlying
mechanism. I will then review the
classical theory for homogeneous Fisher-KPP equations.

In applications, one often wishes to understand the effects of
heterogeneity. This leads to challenging
mathematical questions and I will describe some of them. I will then
discuss more in detail the effect of
inclusion of a line with fast diffusion on biological invasions in the
plane. I will report on recent results
on this question.

### <a id="HBer2"></a> The effect of domain shape on propagation and blocking for reaction-diffusion equations ###

Lecture 2. Wednesday, December 3rd, 14:10 (sharp), room Schreiber 209

#### Abstract: ####

I will discuss reaction-diffusion equations motivated by
biology and medicine for which the aim
is to understand the effect of the shape of the domain on propagation or
on blocking of advancing waves.

I will first describe the motivations of these questions. I will then
discuss various geometric conditions that
lead to either blocking, or partial propagation, or complete
propagation. These questions involve qualitative
results for some non-linear elliptic and parabolic partial differential
equations.
