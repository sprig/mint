#### <a id="Olshanski1"></a> Markov processes of algebraic origin ####

The Brownian motion on the group U(N) of unitary matrices gives rise to a
Markov process on the matrix eigenvalues, that is, on N-particle
configurations on the circle (Freeman Dyson, 1962). Heuristic arguments
show that there should exist an analogous process with infinitely many
particles. However, its rigorous construction is a difficult problem, and
success in this direction has been achieved only in recent years. I will
describe a different model of continuous time Markov dynamics, which is
dual to Dyson's model in the sense that it is formulated in terms of
representations of the groups U(N) rather than eigenvalues. It turns out
that in the "dual" model, the transition to N=infinity can be carried out
by essentially algebraic tools. This is in contrast with Dyson's model
whose study in the N=infinity case requires hard analytic work.

#### <a id="Olshanski2"></a> What are infinite random permutations? ####

Random permutations can be viewed as a combinatorial analog of random
matrices. In random matrix theory, people study the asymptotic behavior of
spectra of large random matrices. Likewise, the literature in combinatorial
probability contains many works on the limiting behavior of various
characteristics of random permutations of large size. But are there
reasonable models of random permutations of actually infinite size?
I will describe some positive results in this direction.
