#### Topological Problems of Data Analysis, I, II. #### {#weinberger}


Abstract: Dealing with large and multidimensional data is a
ubiquitous problem in many scientific and financial settings. In
recent years, geometric and topological methods have become
increasingly popular. They suggest problems that are at the interface
of probability, differential geometry, topology, and analysis. The
first lecture will be devoted to an overview of these ideas, while the
second will focus on some topological problems that arise in trying to
make some heuristics rigorous and/or practical.
